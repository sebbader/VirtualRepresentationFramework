# VirtualRepresentationFramework

This project was created during a master-thesis for education purposes at KIT and is licensed under MIT License. Explanations how to use it and how to get started are in the Wiki section on this page.

The usage of the Framework is very easy. Just do the following steps:

1. Clone project to any directory
2. Open and compile both subprojects (Core and Web).
3. Deploy the Webproject on a Webserver, we recommend TomCat for that. The framework was tested under TomCat 7 and TomCat 9. **NOTE**: The project have to be deployed on a server running under port 9999.
4. Open your browser and access http://<YOUR_SERVER_NAME>:9999/representations. Note: Your server name is normally localhost.
5. You should see the startpage of the framework which is divded into three sections.
6. Click on console and start using the framework.

More details on how to use the console is given in section 2.
